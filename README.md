# PolyThread
PolyThread is the Java library for synchronization and multi-threading that integrates 
**platform threads**, 
**virtual threads**,
**coroutines**, 
**fibers**,
**CompletableFuture**,
and **OS processes**.
Creating a Java library for synchronization and multi-threading that integrates **platform threads**,
**virtual threads**, **coroutines**, **fibers**, **CompletableFuture**, and even **OS processes** is an ambitious but
feasible project. Below, I'll provide an estimation of the effort required, key considerations, and potential
challenges.

The library would aim to:
- Provide abstractions for managing different concurrency models.
- Allow developers to switch between platform threads, virtual threads, coroutines, fibers, etc., with minimal changes.
- Include utilities for common synchronization patterns (e.g., Producer/Consumer, Reader/Writer).
- Handle inter-process communication (IPC) if OS processes are included.
